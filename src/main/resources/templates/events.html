          I served as Partnerships Manager for 504LIFE - a volunteer group who
          organized a series of online telethons to raise funds for first
          responders, medical workers and health organizations in Louisiana. I
          initiated and managed partnerships with fifteen of New Orleans’ iconic
          music venues and a series of other non-profit organizations, local
          interest groups, Mardi Gras Krewes and more. I designed a
          cross-posting marketing strategy to drive traffic from each partner
          organization’s Facebook community. I also built the 504LIFE website.
          504LIFE events raised more than $25,000, and our platform (Sofa King
          Fest) went on to raise an additional $100,000 for COVID relief.

          Memorial Day Meltdown was a 12-hour livestream concert on Memorial Day
          2020 that I executive produced in partnership with Goner Records,
          Burger Records, Slovenly Recordings and Sofa King Fest. I coordinated
          marketing efforts with the labels and the forty bands who
          participated, and I used Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to produce
          the show using a combination of pre-recorded videos and livestreams
          from Chile, Japan, Europe and the U.S. Using cross-posting and
          cross-platform marketing, I generated 50,000 unique views and 8,000
          new users on the Sofa King Fest platform.

          As a Sales & Marketing Associate at Launch Pad, a national co-working
          startup, one of my many duties was to generate leads and drum up
          interest in our new spaces. My initial efforts focused on Launch Pad
          Memphis. In my first month, I developed Memphis on the Move (MOTM), a
          monthly event series that encourages the community to connect and
          learn from leaders who are moving Memphis forward. Between the first
          and second MOTM events, I revamped Launch Pad’s marketing & outreach
          strategy resulting in a 300% increase in RSVPs and attendance.
          Unfortunately, Launch Pad Memphis has since closed due to the COVID-19
          pandemic.
