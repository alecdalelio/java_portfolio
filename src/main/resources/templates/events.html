            I served as Partnerships Manager for 504LIFE - a volunteer group who
            organized a series of online telethons to raise funds for first
            responders, medical workers and health organizations in Louisiana. I
            initiated and managed
            <a href="https://www.504life.org/partners" target="_blank"
              >partnerships</a
            >
            with fifteen of New Orleans’ iconic music venues and a series of
            other non-profit organizations, local interest groups, Mardi Gras
            Krewes and more. I designed a cross-posting marketing strategy to
            drive traffic from each partner organization’s Facebook community. I
            also built the
            <a href="https://504life.org" target="_blank">504LIFE website.</a>
            504LIFE events raised more than $25,000, and our platform (Sofa King
            Fest) went on to raise an additional $100,000 for COVID relief.

            >
            was a 12-hour livestream concert on Memorial Day 2020 that I
            executive produced in partnership with Goner Records, Burger
            Records, Slovenly Recordings and Sofa King Fest. I coordinated
            marketing efforts with the labels and the forty bands who
            participated, and I used Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to produce
            the show using a combination of pre-recorded videos and livestreams
            from Chile, Japan, Europe and the U.S. Using cross-posting and
            cross-platform marketing, I generated 50,000 unique views and 8,000
            new users on the Sofa King Fest platform.

            As a Sales & Marketing Associate at
            <a href="https://lp.co">Launch Pad</a>, a national co-working
            startup, one of my many duties was to generate leads and drum up
            interest in our new spaces. My initial efforts focused on Launch Pad
            Memphis. In my first month, I developed Memphis on the Move (MOTM),
            a monthly event series that encourages the community to connect and
            learn from leaders who are moving Memphis forward. Between the first
            and second MOTM events, I revamped Launch Pad’s marketing & outreach
            strategy resulting in a 300% increase in RSVPs and attendance.
            Unfortunately, Launch Pad Memphis has since closed due to the
            COVID-19 pandemic.
